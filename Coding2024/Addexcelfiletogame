# first gotta import pandas library so that it can access the excel table somehow, openpyx1 would also work
import pandas as pd

# then load the excel file
excel_file_path = 'thewaytotheexcelfile'
# df is the abbreviation to dataframe that is commonly used in python and the panda library
df = pandas.read_excel(excel_file_path)

# this is how to extract words from a specific column (this case the column name is 'words' for example)

words = df['Words'].tolist()
